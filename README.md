Hey Instructor Freeman, thanks so much for your awesome lectures! I've always wanted to make beautiful webpages, and you've demystified the whole process in a fun and intuitive
way. If you haven't guessed yet, i'm a huge music nerd. You should check out karamel kel If youre into low key background beats (not sure if that's your thing, or just a class thing), link below. Unfortunately not up on spotify yet :(
