Hey Instructor Freeman, Thanks so much for your awesome lectures! I've always wanted to make beautiful webpages, and you've demystified the whole process in a fun and intuitive
way. If you havent guessed, i'm a huge music nerd. My friends and I pass around any awesome music we find and we've built up a huge collection. You should check out karamel kel If youre into low key background beats (not sure if that's your thing, or just a class thing), link below. Unfortunately Not on spotify :(
