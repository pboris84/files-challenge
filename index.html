		Spike is a fictional bounty hunter from the Cowboy Bebop tv show. Set in the year 2071, He and his partner Jet hunt down bounties across the solar system for pay. Spike is proficient with weaponry (such as his personal Jericho 941 as well as other guns and explosives), hand-to-hand combat skills, and slieght of hand. He is a skilled martial artist and a practitioner of Jeet Kune Do. Spike is also a pilot and flies a converted Asteroid racer called Swordfish II, which is armed with four machine guns, missile pylons, and a plasma cannon. When he is shown not working, Spike is very laid back, sarcastic, and lively to the dismay of his crew mates. He is typically found either resting on the couch or reading a magazine. Spike's philosophy seems to be based on the ancient samurai ideals of immediacy, such as considering oneself as dead and the idea of death as being an awakening from a dream, which are both elements of bushido illustrated in the Hagakure. His listed dislikes include children, pets, and women with attitude.
