		Spike is a fictional bounty hunter who was born on Mars, June 26, 2044. According to the anime guides, he is 27 years old and has fluffy dark-green hair[10] and brown eyes; one of which is artificial and lighter than the other. His right eye was surgically replaced with a cybernetic one. He is usually dressed in a blue leisure suit, with a yellow shirt and boots similar to those worn by Arsène Lupin III. Spike often smokes cigarettes, despite rain or “no smoking” signs.[13] He stands 6'1" and weighs 155 lbs.

		Spike makes use of sleight of hand techniques to win card games, pickpocket, and slip things onto other people unnoticed. He is also shown to sneak up on enemies through disguise or quiet movement. He is proficient with weaponry (such as his personal Jericho 941 as well as other guns and explosives) and hand-to-hand combat skills. He is a skilled martial artist and a practitioner of Jeet Kune Do. Spike is also a pilot and flies a converted Asteroid racer called Swordfish II, which is armed with four machine guns, missile pylons, and a plasma cannon.

		When he is shown not working, Spike is very laid back, sarcastic, and lively to the dismay of his crew mates. He is typically found either resting on the couch or reading a magazine. Spike's philosophy seems to be based on the ancient samurai ideals of immediacy, such as considering oneself as dead and the idea of death as being an awakening from a dream, which are both elements of bushidō illustrated in the Hagakure. His listed dislikes include children, pets, and women with attitude.

		Watanabe has said that Spike has a habit of being very indirect with his emotions; for example, he may behave antagonistically towards someone he actually likes. He says that this could apply to Spike's relationship with Faye.
