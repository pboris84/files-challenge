    <p> Spike is a fictional bounty hunter from the Cowboy Bebop TV show. Set in the year 2071, he and his partner 
    Jet hunt down bounties across the solar system for pay. Spike is proficient with weaponry (such as his personal 
    Jericho 941 as well as other guns and explosives), hand-to-hand combat skills, and sleight of hand. He is a 
    skilled martial artist and a practitioner of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do. Spike is also a pilot and flies a converted 
    Asteroid racer called Swordfish II, which is armed with four machine guns, missile pylons, and a plasma cannon. 
    When he's not working, Spike is very laid back, sarcastic, and lively to the dismay of his crew mates. He is 
    typically found either resting on the couch or reading a magazine. Spike's philosophy is based on the ancient 
    samurai ideals of immediacy, which includes seeing life to be only a dream, and dying to be awakening from that 
    dream, which are both elements of Bushido as illustrated in the Hagakure. His listed dislikes include children, 
    pets, women with attitude, and letting an expensive bounty get away. </p>
